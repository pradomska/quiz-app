# quiz-app

I'm oing to create a quiz app called Quizzler, which is going to be built using tkinter. I'm able to keep track of my score and see the true/false question show up in the middle and then I can select true or false. 

The questions that I'm answering come from the open trivia database which contains loads of questions. So I don't have to make up the questions and I can even select which category of questions I want and also how many questions I want.
